### Scroll View
This project demonstrates a basic UI implementation in iOS using Swift and UIKit. The key component of this UI is a UIScrollView that contains a paragraph of text. The text is displayed using a custom font, which has been downloaded from the internet in the form of a .ttf file.

### Features:
- **UIScrollView**: A scroll view has been added to allow users to scroll through the content if it exceeds the visible area of the screen.
- **Custom Font**: The paragraph text within the UILabel uses a custom font. The font file was downloaded as a .ttf file and integrated into the project.
- **Font Configuration**: The custom font was configured by adding the .ttf file to the project and updating the Info.plist file accordingly to enable its use within the app.
